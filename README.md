# Habit Tracker

**Habit Tracker** is a full-stack Django web application designed to help users build better habits by tracking their daily progress and monitering this over time. Developed as part of my Milestone Project 4 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer course. This project showcases the culmination of all modules covered throughout the programme. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to support users in forming positive habits and maintaining consistency. Users can create and manage their own habits, track their completion using an intuitive calendar, and unlock motivational badges as they progress.

## User Stories 

### Generic (Guest/Public) User

- As a Guest User, I want to easily register for an account so I can start tracking my habits.

### Registered (Logged-In) User

- As a Registered User, I want to add new habits so I can build healthy routines.
- As a Registered User, I want to mark my habits as completed on a calendar so I can track my consistency.
- As a Registered User, I want to view visual charts of my habit progress so I can stay motivated.
- As a Registered User, I want to unlock badges when I hit milestones so I feel accomplished.
- As a Registered User, I want to receive reminders for when I am behind on habits to stay on track.
- As a Registered User, I want to edit or delete my habits if my routine changes.
- As a Registered User, I want to view all the badges I‚Äôve unlocked 
- As a Registered User, I want to log out securely when I‚Äôm done using the app.

### Site Administrator

- As a Site Administrator, I want to assign badges so users can earn them by completing habits.


### Developer (Project Author)

- As a Developer, I want to build a secure, scalable Django app that uses both front-end and back-end features.
- As a Developer, I want to demonstrate my ability to manage users, authentication, and admin logic.
- As a Developer, I want to apply clean UI/UX principles so the app looks professional and is easy to navigate.
- As a Developer, I want to use GitHub for version control with clear commits to demonstrate my development process.
- As a Developer, I want to complete the project using Agile principles and user stories, so it‚Äôs clear and well-managed.


## Features
This Habit Tracker project was developed using **Django 4** in conjunction with **Bootstrap 5**, making it a fully responsive and mobile-first app. The application was built as part of **Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)**. It draws on all prior modules and integrates both frontend and backend technologies into a single, functioning web app.

Python 3.13.1 was used as the base language, and the project was managed in **Visual Studio Code** with Git and GitHub for version control. The project uses Django‚Äôs built-in templating system, URL routing, authentication tools, and Object-Relational Mapping to manage data through a SQLite3 database.

The frontend was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5, while dynamic user interactions and progress visuals were implemented with JavaScript and Google Charts.

### User Registration, Login & Authentication
- Django‚Äôs built-in authentication system allows users to register, log in, and log out securely.
- Custom messages guide users through successful or failed login/logout attempts.
- Access to habit management is restricted to logged-in users only.
- Logged-in users are automatically redirected to their dashboard, while unauthenticated users are prevented from accessing protected routes such as the sidebar.

### Habit Management (CRUD)
- Users can create new habits by specifying a name, frequency, and target completion values.
- Full CRUD functionality is available:
  - **Create** a habit
  - **Read/View** habits in a list or calendar
  - **Update** habits (e.g. editing habit names)
  - **Delete** habits individually
- Habit data is stored in the SQLite3 database and tied specifically to the user account that created it.

### Calendar View & Daily Progress Tracking
- Each user sees a calendar grid with daily habit tracking.
- ‚úÖ indicates a completed habit for the day, ‚ùå indicates a missed one.
- Navigation toggles allow users to move between calendar months.
- Habit completion is stored per day, allowing Django to calculate weekly/monthly progress accurately.

### Badge System for Motivation
- Badges act as motivational incentives, rewarding users for consistency.
- e.g. badge types:
  - **30-Day Streak Badge**: Automatically awarded after marking a habit as complete for 30 consecutive days.
- Badges have "Locked" and "Unlocked" states. Users can view both in their badge panel.
- Badges are linked to models and stored in the database, allowing users to persist achievements.

### Google Charts Integration
- Weekly habit completion data is displayed using Google Charts.
- Charts are dynamically generated based on user activity and habit data passed from Django views to JavaScript.
- This provides users with a clear, visual representation of their consistency and progress.


### Success Messages

The app uses Django‚Äôs built-in messages framework to show feedback to users when actions are completed successfully. These messages include:

- ‚úÖ Habit added successfully!
- Habit deleted successfully!


Messages are styled with Bootstrap alert classes and appear at the top of the screen. They fade out automatically after a few seconds using JavaScript, so users don't need to click to dismiss them.

---

### Reminder Emails

The app includes a custom reminder system that checks for incomplete habits and sends reminder emails to users. 

- üïì Emails are triggered manually using:
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py send_reminders
</details>

## Testing

### Email Functionality Testing

This project uses Django‚Äôs built-in email system for email confirmations. Although email sending is not a core feature of the app due to a lack of time, the configuration must be valid to prevent deployment issues.

### Configuration Issue on Heroku

During deployment to Heroku, the application crashed due to missing environment variables required for Django‚Äôs email settings. 

<details>
<summary>The error was identified using the Heroku CLI:</summary>


```
heroku logs --tail
```

The logs revealed the following error:

```
decouple.UndefinedValueError: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL not found. Declare it as envvar or define a default value.
```

This was caused by the following environment-dependent email settings in settings.py, which use decouple.config():

```
EMAIL_HOST = config('EMAIL_HOST')
EMAIL_PORT = config('EMAIL_PORT', cast=int)
EMAIL_USE_TLS = config('EMAIL_USE_TLS', cast=bool)
EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = config('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
```

Since these variables were not defined in Heroku's Config Vars, Django raised an error and the app crashed.
</details>


Solution
To resolve the issue, dummy environment variable values were added in the Heroku dashboard:

1. Go to my Heroku app.
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Reveal Config Vars.
3. Add the following keys and dummy values:

### Heroku Email Config Vars (Dummy Values)

| Key                  | Value                  |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| EMAIL_HOST           | smtp.gmail.com         |
| EMAIL_PORT           | 587                    |
| EMAIL_USE_TLS        | True                   |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER      | test@example.com       |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD  | dummy-password         |
| DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL   | noreply@example.com    |

> **Note:** These are placeholder values added purely to allow successful deployment. No actual email functionality is active in the deployed app.

---

### Result

After adding the above config vars:

- The app booted successfully on Heroku.  
- The `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` command completed without errors.  
- The Heroku deployment pipeline ran successfully and the live site was accessible again.

This resolved the deployment blocker and allowed the project to be submitted successfully.




## Deployment

This Habit Tracker full-stack web application was developed using **Visual Studio Code** and version controlled with **Git** (locally) and **GitHub** (remotely). Deployment was carried out using **Heroku**, with production settings managed via environment variables and the Config Vars feature provided by the Heroku dashboard.

### Environment Variables

To keep sensitive information safe, secret keys and configuration values were stored in an `env.py` file locally, which was added to the `.gitignore` file to ensure it was not committed to the public repository.

These values were then manually entered into **Heroku** under:

###  Steps to Deploy on Heroku

#### 1. Project Setup

- Installed **Gunicorn** for WSGI support and updated requirements:
    ```bash
    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

- Created a `Procfile` at the project root (no file extension, case-sensitive):
    ```
    web: gunicorn p4_habit_tracker.wsgi
    ```

- Added and committed it:
    ```bash
    git add Procfile
    git commit -m "Add Procfile for Heroku deployment"
    ```

- Installed **Whitenoise** to serve static files:
    ```bash
    pip3 install whitenoise
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

- Updated `settings.py` middleware:
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
        "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",  # üëà Add this line just below SecurityMiddleware
        ...
    ]
    ```

- Updated `STATIC_ROOT` in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"
    ```

#### 2. Preparing for Deployment

- Ran collectstatic locally to make sure static files are ready:
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

- Confirmed files appeared in `/staticfiles/` and ensured only one copy of `styles.css` and `script.js` was in the correct folder.

#### 3. Pushing to Heroku

- Logged into Heroku CLI:
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

- Created a new Heroku app:
    ```bash
    heroku create p4-habit-tracker
    ```

- Added the Heroku remote (if needed):
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a p4-habit-tracker
    ```

- Deployed the app:
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

#### 4. Config Vars and Environment Settings

- In the Heroku dashboard:
  - Navigated to **Settings > Config Vars**
  - Added the following:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY: your-django-secret-key
    DEBUG: False
    ```

#### 5. Final Setup Commands

- Ran migrations and created a superuser:
    ```bash
    heroku run python3 manage.py migrate
    heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

- Optionally removed this (added earlier during testing):
    ```bash
    heroku config:unset DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
    ```

- If static files weren't showing up earlier:
    ```bash
    heroku run python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

- Scaled dynos (if required):
    ```bash
    heroku ps:scale web=1
    ```
