## Features
This Habit Tracker project was developed using **Django 4** in conjunction with **Bootstrap 5**, making it a fully responsive and mobile-first app. The application was built as part of **Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)**. It draws on all prior modules and integrates both frontend and backend technologies into a single, functioning web app.

Python 3.13.1 was used as the base language, and the project was managed in **Visual Studio Code** with Git and GitHub for version control. The project uses Django‚Äôs built-in templating system, URL routing, authentication tools, and Object-Relational Mapping to manage data through a SQLite3 database.

The frontend was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5, while dynamic user interactions and progress visuals were implemented with JavaScript and Google Charts.

<details>
  <summary><strong>The project boasts a wide range of features:</strong></summary>

<br/>

### User Registration, Login & Authentication
- Django‚Äôs built-in authentication system allows users to register, log in, and log out securely.
- Custom messages guide users through successful or failed login/logout attempts.
- Access to habit management is restricted to logged-in users only.
- Logged-in users are automatically redirected to their dashboard, while unauthenticated users are prevented from accessing protected routes such as the sidebar.

### Habit Management (CRUD)
- Users can create new habits by specifying a name, frequency, and target completion values.
- Full CRUD functionality is available:
  - **Create** a habit
  - **Read/View** habits in a list or calendar
  - **Update** habits (e.g. editing habit names)
  - **Delete** habits individually
- Habit data is stored in the SQLite3 database and tied specifically to the user account that created it.

### Calendar View & Daily Progress Tracking
- Each user sees a calendar grid with daily habit tracking.
- ‚úÖ indicates a completed habit for the day, ‚ùå indicates a missed one.
- Navigation toggles allow users to move between calendar months.
- Habit completion is stored per day, allowing Django to calculate weekly/monthly progress accurately.

### Badge System for Motivation
- Badges act as motivational incentives, rewarding users for consistency.
- e.g. badge types:
  - **30-Day Streak Badge**: Automatically awarded after marking a habit as complete for 30 consecutive days.
- Badges have "Locked" and "Unlocked" states. Users can view both in their badge panel.
- Badges are linked to models and stored in the database, allowing users to persist achievements.

### Google Charts Integration
- Weekly habit completion data is displayed using Google Charts.
- Charts are dynamically generated based on user activity and habit data passed from Django views to JavaScript.
- This provides users with a clear, visual representation of their consistency and progress.


### Success Messages

The app uses Django‚Äôs built-in messages framework to show feedback to users when actions are completed successfully. These messages include:

- ‚úÖ Habit added successfully!
- Habit deleted successfully!


Messages are styled with Bootstrap alert classes and appear at the top of the screen. They fade out automatically after a few seconds using JavaScript, so users don't need to click to dismiss them.

---

### Reminder Emails

The app includes a custom reminder system that checks for incomplete habits and sends reminder emails to users. 

- üïì Emails are triggered manually using:
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py send_reminders
</details>

## Structure 
The Habit Tracker app consists of multiple templates, each responsible for a specific user-facing feature. All templates extend from base.html except for login.html and register.htnl. 

### base.html
This is the shared base template extended by all other pages. It includes:

- The site-wide navigation bar
- Conditional content based on authentication using

``
{% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
    <!-- Show authenticated content -->
{% else %}
    <!-- Show guest links -->
{% endif %}
``

### dashboard.html
This is the main page after login. It displays:

- A personalised greeting
- Motivational quote
- Today‚Äôs habits with checkboxes
- Google Charts for weekly and category-based habit progress
- Pinned user notes

### calendar.html

- Displays a calendar view with ‚úÖ and ‚ùå icons to show if habits were completed or missed.
- Data is updated via JavaScript and synced with the backend using the Fetch API.
- Includes habit and date filters.

### habit_list.html

- Displays all user-created habits.
- Each habit entry includes its name, frequency, category, and target
- Users can edit or delete habits.
- Includes feedback messages for actions like delete.

### add_habit.html

- A form for creating new habits.
- Validates required fields.

Fields include:
- Habit name
- Category
- Frequency (e.g., Daily)
- Target number of days

### badges.html

- Displays a collection of user-earned and locked badges.
- Uses a badge system to gamify habit completion.

### add_note.html

- Allows users to add and save notes.
- Notes can be pinned to the dashboard.

### register.html

- Page for user registration.

Displays error messages for:
- Existing username
- Invalid email
- Password mismatch

On success, user is redirected to the dashboard.

### login.html

- Page for user login.
- Displays validation errors for incorrect username/password.
- Includes link to register if the user doesn't have an account.



## Testing

### Browsers
The site was manually tested on the following browsers:
- Google Chrome (v125+)
- Safari (macOS + iOS)

On Google Chrome, responsiveness was checked using Chrome DevTools with multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### Frontend Testing

#### HTML

<details>
<summary> View HTML W3C Markup Validator </summary>

![Alt text for accessibility](assets/images/html-checker.png)

</details>

- Validated using [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

#### CSS

<details>
<summary> View CSS W3C Markup Validator </summary>

![Alt text for accessibility](assets/images/css-checker.png)

</details>

- Validated using [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- **1 error** was found in the Font Awesome CDN (`all.min.css`) related to a CSS variable not being recognised as a valid transform value. This is a known issue and does not affect site functionality.
- **513 warnings** were mostly from external libraries such as Bootstrap and Font Awesome. These include:
  - Vendor-specific properties (e.g. `-webkit-`, `-moz-`) used for cross-browser compatibility.
  - CSS variables, which cannot be statically checked by the validator.
  - Deprecated properties like `clip` and `break-word`.

These warnings are expected when using modern frameworks and third-party libraries. Custom CSS was reviewed to ensure it follows best practices and is standards-compliant.


#### Manual User Flow Tests
| Functionality | Test Outcome |
|--------------|---------------|
| Navigation links (Home, Dashboard, Register, Login) | ‚úÖ All links worked correctly and routed to intended pages |
| Register new account | ‚úÖ Account created, redirected to dashboard |
| Login/logout | ‚úÖ Verified successful and unsuccessful login attempts |
| Add new habit | ‚úÖ Form saved valid data; form errors appeared for missing/invalid fields |
| Calendar habit checkboxes | ‚úÖ Toggled correctly and saved completion data via Fetch API |
| Chart updates on checkbox changes | ‚úÖ Weekly progress chart updated dynamically with no page refresh |
| Badge unlock system | ‚úÖ 30-day streak badge unlocked after marking streaks in the database |

---

### Backend Testing
#### Django
All backend logic was tested manually and via the Django shell (`python3 manage.py shell`).

**User Authentication Checks:**
- Used `request.user.is_authenticated` in templates to display appropriate content:
  ```django
  {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}!</p>
  {% else %}
    <a href="/login/">Sign in</a>
  {% endif %}
  ```
- Prevented access to certain pages unless the user was logged in.

**Database Testing with Shell:**
- Created habits manually:
  ```python
  from habits.models import Habit
  from django.contrib.auth.models import User
  user = User.objects.get(username="testuser")
  Habit.objects.create(name="Exercise", user=user, frequency="daily", target=30)
  ```
- Marked habits completed via `HabitCompletion` model:
  ```python
  from habits.models import HabitCompletion
  from datetime import date
  hc = HabitCompletion.objects.create(habit=habit, date=date.today())
  ```
- Tested badge logic manually:
  ```python
  from badges.models import Badge, UserBadge
  UserBadge.objects.filter(user=user).update(unlocked=True)
  ```

### JavaScript (Google Charts)
| Feature | Manual Test Outcome |
|---------|----------------------|
| Google Charts on dashboard | ‚úÖ Renders with live habit completion data |
| Chart updates after marking habits | ‚úÖ Data updates via JavaScript and chart redraws successfully |
| Chart fetch and display errors | ‚úÖ Console logs show successful fetch and render |

**Testing snippet used:**
```js
fetch('/get-habit-data/')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => drawChart(data));
```

### Bugs
- Heroku deployment failed initially due to missing config vars ‚Üí fixed
- Static file path conflicts ‚Üí resolved by cleaning duplicate filenames
- App crashed due to missing `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` ‚Üí fixed by setting dummy vars

### Email Functionality Testing

This project uses Django‚Äôs built-in email system for email confirmations. Although email sending is not a core feature of the app due to a lack of time, the configuration must be valid to prevent deployment issues.

### Configuration Issue on Heroku

During deployment to Heroku, the application crashed due to missing environment variables required for Django‚Äôs email settings. 

<details>
<summary>The error was identified using the Heroku CLI:</summary>


```
heroku logs --tail
```

The logs revealed the following error:

```
decouple.UndefinedValueError: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL not found. Declare it as envvar or define a default value.
```

This was caused by the following environment-dependent email settings in settings.py, which use decouple.config():

```
EMAIL_HOST = config('EMAIL_HOST')
EMAIL_PORT = config('EMAIL_PORT', cast=int)
EMAIL_USE_TLS = config('EMAIL_USE_TLS', cast=bool)
EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = config('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
```

Since these variables were not defined in Heroku's Config Vars, Django raised an error and the app crashed.
</details>


Solution
To resolve the issue, dummy environment variable values were added in the Heroku dashboard:

1. Go to my Heroku app.
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Reveal Config Vars.
3. Add the following keys and dummy values:

### Heroku Email Config Vars (Dummy Values)

| Key                  | Value                  |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| EMAIL_HOST           | smtp.gmail.com         |
| EMAIL_PORT           | 587                    |
| EMAIL_USE_TLS        | True                   |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER      | test@example.com       |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD  | dummy-password         |
| DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL   | noreply@example.com    |

> **Note:** These are placeholder values added purely to allow successful deployment. No actual email functionality is active in the deployed app.

---

All other features functioned as expected after thorough manual and shell-based testing.

### Result

After adding the above config vars:

- The app booted successfully on Heroku.  
- The `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` command completed without errors.  
- The Heroku deployment pipeline ran successfully and the live site was accessible again.

This resolved the deployment blocker and allowed the project to be submitted successfully.




## Deployment

This Habit Tracker full-stack web application was developed using **Visual Studio Code** and version controlled with **Git** (locally) and **GitHub** (remotely). Deployment was carried out using **Heroku**, with production settings managed via environment variables and the Config Vars feature provided by the Heroku dashboard.

### Environment Variables

To keep sensitive information safe, secret keys and configuration values were stored in an `env.py` file locally, which was added to the `.gitignore` file to ensure it was not committed to the public repository.

These values were then manually entered into **Heroku** under:

###  Steps to Deploy on Heroku

#### 1. Project Setup

- Installed **Gunicorn** for WSGI support and updated requirements:
    ```bash
    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

- Created a `Procfile` at the project root (no file extension, case-sensitive):
    ```
    web: gunicorn p4_habit_tracker.wsgi
    ```

- Added and committed it:
    ```bash
    git add Procfile
    git commit -m "Add Procfile for Heroku deployment"
    ```

- Installed **Whitenoise** to serve static files:
    ```bash
    pip3 install whitenoise
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

- Updated `settings.py` middleware:
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
        "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",  # üëà Add this line just below SecurityMiddleware
        ...
    ]
    ```

- Updated `STATIC_ROOT` in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"
    ```

#### 2. Preparing for Deployment

- Ran collectstatic locally to make sure static files are ready:
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

- Confirmed files appeared in `/staticfiles/` and ensured only one copy of `styles.css` and `script.js` was in the correct folder.

#### 3. Pushing to Heroku

- Logged into Heroku CLI:
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

- Created a new Heroku app:
    ```bash
    heroku create p4-habit-tracker
    ```

- Added the Heroku remote (if needed):
    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a p4-habit-tracker
    ```

- Deployed the app:
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

#### 4. Config Vars and Environment Settings

- In the Heroku dashboard:
  - Navigated to **Settings > Config Vars**
  - Added the following:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY: your-django-secret-key
    DEBUG: False
    ```

#### 5. Final Setup Commands

- Ran migrations and created a superuser:
    ```bash
    heroku run python3 manage.py migrate
    heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

- Optionally removed this (added earlier during testing):
    ```bash
    heroku config:unset DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
    ```

- If static files weren't showing up earlier:
    ```bash
    heroku run python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

- Scaled dynos (if required):
    ```bash
    heroku ps:scale web=1
    ```
